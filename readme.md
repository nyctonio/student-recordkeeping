-------------------  Hello Programmer ----------------
this is a project of a student database 
----->if you encounter an error while running the main.py

-->  There may be 2 main reasons for that 

1.  your directory might be wrong. Open the whole folder tkinter_project in vs code
    the directory in which this is running should be like.
    C:\Users\rites\Desktop\tkinter_proj>
    it means that there should be nothing after tkinter_proj in the directory open 
    the whole folder
    --- to know your current working directory use ---
    import os
    print(os.getcwd())
    
2.  if an error occour like ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PIL'  
    most probably you have not installed the PIL this is a library for 
    using images in the tkinter use---->  pip install pillow
    in your command line or make the code line 4,32,33,34 commented
    but this will hide the chitkara university logo
